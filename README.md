# C Programming Journey

Welcome to my C Programming Journey repository! This repository documents my progress and learning in becoming a master C programmer within a 5-month timeframe. The goal is to follow the "C Programming Absolute Beginner's Guide" by Greg Perry and Dean Miller and complete the book's content in four months.
